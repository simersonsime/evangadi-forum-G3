 

Git Local Workflow (Team Standard)

This workflow ensures conflicts are resolved locally in VS Code before pushing code to the remote repository.

---

Step 1: Update main branch
Switch to main and pull the latest changes.

git checkout main

---

Step 2: Switch to your feature branch
Each team member must work on their own branch.

git checkout your-branch-name

---

Step 3: Work on your assigned task

* Write code only related to your task
* Test your changes locally

---

Step 4: Commit your changes (do not push yet)

git add .
git commit -m "task: short description"

---

Step 5: Merge latest main into your branch (local)
This step prevents conflicts on the remote repository.
git checkout main 

git pull origin main

git checkout your-branch-name

git merge main

If conflicts appear:

* Resolve conflicts using VS Code
* Save the files
* Then commit the merge

git add .
git commit -m "merge main into feature branch"

---

Step 6: Push your branch to GitHub

git push origin your-branch-name

---

Team Rules

* Always pull main before working
* Always merge main into your branch before pushing
* Never push directly to main
* Resolve conflicts locally in VS Code

Rule of Thumb
Before pushing your branch, always merge the latest main locally and resolve conflicts first.
